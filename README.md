# Customer-Segmentation

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using KMeans clustering on the "Mall Customers" dataset. The dataset contains information about customers such as their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Load the dataset using pandas.
2. Display the first few rows of the dataset.
3. Check the shape of the dataset.

## Data Visualization
### 1. Pairplot of the dataset colored by gender.
### 2. Countplot of gender distribution.
### 3. Distribution plots for age, annual income, and spending score.
